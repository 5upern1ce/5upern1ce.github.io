    <h2 style = "text-align: left; color:white"> Video Games </h2>
    <p style="color:white; font-size: large;">I have been playing video games since I was a small child. One of my earliest memories is playing Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Wii virtual console. 
I have played many games since then, but my favorite games are the Legend of Zelda series. I have played almost every game in the series, and I love the lore, the characters, and the gameplay.
The two games I am yet to finish are <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Spirit_Tracks" target="_blank">Spirit Tracks</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Oracle_of_Seasons_and_Oracle_of_Ages" target="_blank">Oracle of Seasons</a>. 
I never finished Spirit Tracks due to the DS Zelda's having unnatural controls which really did not gel with me at the time I finished Phantom Hourglass, its sister game of which it shares a lot of similarities, especially its controls.
I never finished Oracle of Seasons due to playing Oracle of Ages, its dual release sister game, for the first time during a busy point in my life.
I then decided  break was needed from the Oracle games and I have yet to get back to it.

<br>
My top 5 games of all time are:
<br>
1. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time" target="_blank"> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>
<br>
What more can I say about Ocarina that hasn't been said already? It is a masterpiece of a game that has sucked countless hours from my life due to its sheer quality. Being the first 3D Zelda entry, it was revolutionary. 
1998 was truly a revolutionary year, with games like <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)" target ="_blank">Half-Life</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_2" target="_blank">Resident Evil 2</a> also being released.
Ocarina's beautifully colourful world, the tight controls and beautifully crafted dungeons, utilising just the right amount of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania" target="_blank">Metroidvania</a> elements, make it a game that is a must play for every video game fan ever.
<br>
2. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Skyward_Sword" target = "_blank"> The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a>
<br>
This is a truly devisive pick. Probably the most devisive Zelda game ever made. I love this game to an incredible degree.
The story is fantastic, satiating my childhood curiosity of the origins of the Master Sword, Hyrule and the Zelda story as a whole.
The characters are beautifully memorable, with Groose being a standout character from the game. 
The relationship between Link and Zelda is truly beautiful and the game's ending is one of the most emotional moments in the series.
Fi is truly the best companion character in the series, starting off as a cold, emotionless robot, but slowly developing into a character with a heart.
You truly feel for Fi at the end of the game, with <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7P_cdgPsK4" target="_blank">her farewell theme</a> being one of the most emotional pieces of music in the series.
The dungeons are gorgeously designed, with the Ancient Cistern being a standout dungeon in the series.
The art style is like walking through a watercolour painting, with the game's art direction being truly the best in the series, if you ask me.
<br>
3. <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne" target="_blank"> Bloodborne</a>
<br>
A bit of a sudden change from the beginning of the list, but Bloodborne is truly a landmark of gothic horror in video games.
The eldrich, Lovecraftian horror of the game is truly terrifying, with the game's world being truly haunting.
The game is excruciatingly difficult, but the feeling of satisfaction you get from beating a boss is truly unmatched.
The fast paced gameplay is a welcome change from the slow, methodical gameplay of the Souls games, especially the souls games pre-<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls_III" target="_blank">Dark Souls III</a>.
Bloodborne is the game that set the groundwork for Dark Souls III, and despite it not being the perfect game, Bloodborne truly holds a special place in my heart.
It birthed my interest in gothic horror and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft" target="_blank">H.P. Lovecraft</a> as a whole.
